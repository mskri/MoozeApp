Status bar macOS app for toggling mute on your microphone with a global shortcut or via status bar toggle.

---

Created this small utility app to help myself mute microphone when in a meetings. Got annoyed by having to find the tab on a browser which has the conference call to mute or unmute my microphone. If focus was not on the correct tab browser bookmarked the wrong tab (toggle mute in Google Meet and bookmark current page share shame shortcut).

Tested on macOS Catalina 10.15.3

## Usage

Toggle microphone on/off with global shortcut using `⌃⌥⌘m` _(control + option + command + m)_.

Microphone can also be toggled by left clicking status bar icon. Menu open on right click.
